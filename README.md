# hbr_reg

Simple linear regression for the sugar maple (*Acer saccharum*) data sample from the [lterdatasampler](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/) package in R. Data was collected at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest and measures plant specimen from calcium-treated and control watersheds. This example uses dried leaf mass (grams) to predict the corrected leaf area (cm<sup>2</sup>).
